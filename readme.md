# What is artificial intelligence?

ai is all about enabling a machine to take their own decissions without explicit programming.

# How it take decissions?

it has a model trained as we have mechanics or teachers in real life they first learns then do their works accordingly, same process works in ai model learns first from data ten make an algorithms and provide an output via API.

# What is API?

API stands for application programming interface, it is a set of defined rules that enables different applications to communicate with frontend and backend like real life brokers do.

# What is algorithms?

algorithms are a set of rules that are used to solve a problem or perform a task, or you can say a workflow defined in our own words.
